## Group Project: "Analysing Sports Popularity based on Olympic athletes and medals"

### Introduction
This data science project analyses sports popularity based on Olympic athletes and medals won. 
The client is a large sports group that includes franchising leisure centres, supporting local councils with their sports programming, and sports marketing for the general UK population. 
The vision is to share the passion of participating in sports activities with everyone and to support access to these activities.

### Aims and Objectives
The main aim is to analyse historical data on Olympic athletes to answer five research questions:
1. What are the main patterns in Team GB medals since the modern Olympics were founded in 1896?
2. Which successful athletes (Team GB and non-GB) can be used to market sports to different generations?
3. Which new Olympic sports have Team GB participated in?
4. Which sports may interest and inspire customers based on Olympic success?
5. How can this year‚Äôs Olympic results support up-to-date decision-making?
