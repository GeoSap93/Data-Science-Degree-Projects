## Python (Anime Trivia Console App üíª)
This console application retrieves anime trivia questions from an API, allowing users to answer them interactively. 
The app gives immediate feedback on correct or incorrect answers and logs the results in a text file for future reference.
__Features__
- Retrieves anime trivia questions from an API.
- Displays questions with multiple-choice answers for the user.
- Captures the user's answer selections.
- Provides feedback on the tally of correct and incorrect responses.
- Cleanses and saves questions in a text file, removing any special characters.
- Logs the date and time of each session in the results file.

## SQL (AHS School Database üè´)
This SQL code is for managing a school database named AHS. 
The database includes tables for storing information on pupils, parents and attendance records, with defined relationships between them. 
This structure enables the tracking of student attendance and parental information with multiple constraints and relational joins.
The code covers database creation, data insertion, querying and various operations such as viewing, updating and deleting records, designed to help a school manage student records and parent contacts efficiently.

## APIs (Bingham Member's Club ‚ô£Ô∏è)
This project includes a database and a Flask API for managing member bookings at the Bingham Members Club. 
It allows users to manage member records, including joining dates, room bookings and deletion of records when members leave the club. 
The project contains an SQL script to set up and populate the database, a Python script with functions for CRUD operations on member data and a Flask API to enable interaction with the database through HTTP requests.

# Specialisation Degree Project
## Sports Popularity Analysis - Olympic Athletes and Medals
This project analyses sports popularity based on historical Olympic data, focusing on the success of Team GB and global athletes. 
This data science project was completed for a major UK sports group, aiding in decisions for facility planning, community programming, and targeted marketing.

## Project Overview
Our data-driven approach addresses five primary questions related to Olympic success, aiming to inform strategic decisions in sports development and promotion:

1. Patterns in Team GB Olympic medals since 1896
2. Marketing sports through successful athletes
3. Team GB participation in new Olympic sports
4. Customer interest inspired by Olympic success
5. Supporting decision-making with recent Olympic results
6. Data Sources and Cleaning

The project combines three main datasets for comprehensive coverage of Olympic events from 1896 to 2024, including the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 data (via API).
Data cleaning involved handling missing values, resolving discrepancies and standardising formats to ensure reliable analysis.

## Analysis & Findings
### Key Findings
- __Medal Patterns__: Team GB's success has surged since 1996, correlating with increased funding. Top sports include athletics, swimming, and cycling.
- __Athlete Marketing__: Prominent athletes such as Duncan Scott (swimming) and Jason Kenny (cycling) offer strong marketing potential.
- __New Sports__: Skateboarding, sport climbing and BMX have gained popularity, appealing especially to younger demographics.
- __Popular Sports__: Team GB shows consistent medal performance in sports like rowing and hockey, indicating strong customer interest.
- __2024 Olympics Insights__: Team GB's recent achievements highlight sports such as athletics and cycling as growth areas.

## Predictive Analysis
Clustering and regression models were applied to forecast sports that may gain popularity. Results suggest a continued rise in participation for athletics, gymnastics and swimming.

## Tools and Technologies
- __Programming & Libraries__: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.), Jupyter Notebook
- __Database__: MySQL for structured data storage and querying
- __API__: Utilised for up-to-date data on the Paris 2024 Olympics
- __Project Management__: Slack, Google Meet and Google Drive for team collaboration

## Project Structure
The code is organised into Jupyter notebooks:

1. __Data Collection & Cleaning__: Combines and processes multiple datasets.
2. __Medal Patterns__: Analyses historical medal trends for Team GB.
3. __Athlete Marketing__: Identifies athletes to enhance marketing efforts.
4. __New Sports Analysis__: Examines participation in newly added sports.
5. __Predictive Modelling__: Forecasts future sports popularity using ML models.

## Limitations
Data limitations include missing data points, gaps in athlete records and reliance on public datasets, which may affect analysis precision. 
Manual adjustments were made for missing athlete data to improve accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project offers actionable insights for the client to enhance sports promotion, allocate resources efficiently and engage the public in sports inspired by Olympic success. Through athlete marketing, focused community programming and facility investments, the findings support the goal of fostering a healthier, more active population.
